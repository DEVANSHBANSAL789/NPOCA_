            <p>
              We are a social initiative focused on mainstreaming Career
              Education & Guidance in the school curriculum.
              <br />
              At NPOCA, we are attempting to build comprehensive career services
              for school students, which would help them identify their talent,
              explore opportunities, and make informed career decisions using
              the best resources available globally.
              <br />
              This, in our view, would help youth stay focused and motivated,
              improve academic performance, and address the issue of
              underemployment and unemployability.
